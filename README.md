Sentiment Analysis and Text Classification in Natural Language Processing

This project was developed independently to explore the applications and techniques of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in data analysis and sentiment classification.

Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis.
Sentiment Analysis: Using machine learning models to classify text data by sentiment.
Visualization: Graphs and charts to analyze and interpret the results.
Model Implementation: Training, evaluating, and fine-tuning classification models.

Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on text data.
Implementation of machine learning techniques for text classification.
Visualization of model performance metrics.
